Hello! I am Keyu Cui, a fourth-year PhD student in Management Science and Engineering at Xi'an Jiaotong University. I am currently participating in a joint program with HEC Paris, under the supervision of Professors [Xitong Li](https://www.hec.edu/en/faculty-research/faculty-directory/faculty-member/li-xitong) and [Shan Liu](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/shanliu). My research focuses on the management of digital platforms, encompassing AI management, pricing strategies, and the management of User-Generated Content (UGC). Recently, I have developed a keen interest in the applications of AI for Science and Social Science.

My work has received revision opportunities at MIS Quarterly, Information Systems Research, and Nature Communications.
