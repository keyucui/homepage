Hello! I am Keyu Cui, a third-year PhD student in Management Science and Engineering at Xi'an Jiaotong University. I am currently participating in a joint program with HEC Paris, under the supervision of Professors Xitong Li and Shan Liu. My research focuses on the management of digital platforms, encompassing AI management, pricing strategies, and the management of User-Generated Content (UGC). Recently, I have developed a keen interest in the applications of AI for Science and Social Science.

I have received an invitation to revise a paper for MIS Quarterly and am preparing several other manuscripts for submission to top journals in Information Systems and general Science fields.
